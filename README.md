# TEST
The Experimental System for Transpilation (TEST) is an experimental system for researching quantum transpilation.

# TODO
## Pauli
- Nice way of handling clifford angles
- Nice way to creat pauli strings
# Synthesize
- At the start merge pauli exps with same strings (should only changes 1-qubit gate count).
